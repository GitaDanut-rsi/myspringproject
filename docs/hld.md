# High-Level Design (HLD) Document

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide a high-level overview of the architecture and design of the Spring Boot application project.

### 1.2 Scope

This document covers the architecture, key components, data flow, and technologies involved in the project.

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 System Description

The Spring Boot application is designed to handle greeting requests, process them, and send back a response. The application exposes a REST endpoint to accept requests.

## 3. Architecture Overview

### 3.1 Architectural Style

The system follows a three-tier architecture consisting of the Presentation Layer, Business Logic Layer, and Data Access Layer.

### 3.2 System Components

1. **Presentation Layer:**
   * Technologies: Spring MVC, REST
   * Description: This layer handles HTTP requests and sends responses.
2. **Business Logic Layer:**
   * Technologies: Spring Boot
   * Description: This layer contains the business logic for processing requests.
3. **Data Access Layer:**
   * Technologies: Spring Data JPA, Hibernate (if database interactions were involved)
   * Description: This layer is responsible for interacting with the database (not applicable in this simple example).

## 4. Component Design

### 4.1 Presentation Layer

* **GreetingController**: Handles HTTP GET requests for greetings.

### 4.2 Business Logic Layer

* **GreetingService**: Contains the business logic for generating greetings.

### 4.3 Data Access Layer

* **Not applicable in this example.**

## 5. Data Flow

### 5.1 User Interactions

1. **Greeting Request**:
   * The user sends a GET request to the `/greeting` endpoint with an optional `name` parameter.
   * The `GreetingController` handles the request and calls the `GreetingService`.
   * The `GreetingService` generates a greeting message and returns it to the `GreetingController`.
   * The `GreetingController` sends the response back to the client.

## 6. Technologies Used

### 6.1 Backend

* **Spring Boot**: A framework for building Java-based applications with minimal configuration.
* **Spring MVC**: A framework for building web applications and RESTful services.

### 6.2 Development Tools

* **IntelliJ IDEA**: An integrated development environment (IDE) for Java development.
* **GitHub Copilot**: An AI-powered code completion tool.

## 7. Security

### 7.1 Authentication and Authorization

* **Spring Security**: Used to handle authentication and authorization (if applicable).

### 7.2 Data Protection

* **Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted before being stored in the database (if applicable).

## 8. Scalability and Performance

### 8.1 Load Balancing

* **Nginx**: Used as a load balancer to distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of the application server.

### 8.2 Caching

* **Redis**: Used for caching frequently accessed data to improve response times (if applicable).

## 9. Deployment

### 9.1 Environment Setup

* **Development Environment**: Local machine setup with Java, Maven, and Spring Boot.
* **Production Environment**: Deployed on cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS) with automated CI/CD pipelines.

### 9.2 Continuous Integration and Deployment

* **GitHub Actions**: Used for automating build, test, and deployment processes.

## 10. Conclusion

This high-level design document provides an overview of the Spring Boot application project, outlining its architecture, components, data flow, technologies, security measures, scalability, and deployment strategies. Further detailed design and implementation steps will be covered in subsequent low-level design documents.
